			Abnormalities in normal blood flow from the heart cause several types of heart diseases, which are commonly known as cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have now become the leading reason of death in India. One fourth of all the deaths are due to CVD. Heart disease and stroke are the predominant causes and are responsible for more than 80% of CVD deaths. The Global Burden of Disease study estimate of age-standardized CVD death rate of 272 per 100 000 population in India is higher than the global average of 235 per 100 000 population. 17.9 million people die each year from CVDs, an estimated 31% of all deaths worldwide. Despite wide heterogeneity in the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors across different regions, CVD has emerged as the leading cause of death in all parts of India, including poorer states and rural areas. The proposed system comprises the scheme and design of an application which uses an efficient machine learning technique to detect heart disease. It can serve as a very useful tool for patients, and medical students to diagnose heart disease. For diagnosis of fatal physiological conditions and symptoms such as heart attack requires 24 hours monitoring of patient’s health after transferring from hospital to home. Using this system, the patient can enter the current parameters of heart and check whether there is a possibility of having cardiovascular disease in future.
